## Overview
A network analysis of interactions between active users in popular communities on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/). This will function as a general overview of a few hand-picked subreddits which would hopefully reveal patterns in behavior for certain communities and reddit as a whole. Goal is to quantify levels of [homophily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophily)/[assortativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assortativity) to support a hypothesis that Reddit is becoming an echo chamber. The dataset was obtained from the 2017 paper <em>[Loyalty in Online Communities](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/index_files/loyalty.pdf) - Hamilton et al.</em>

## Numbers
2046 subreddits
30 categories

## Methods
No particular reasoning for the choice of categories. First allowed ChatGPT to group a random sample as it saw fit, then added groups as I noticed common themes.
